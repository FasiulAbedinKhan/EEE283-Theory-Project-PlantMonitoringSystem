# EEE283-Theory-Project-PlantMonitoringSystem
In our EEE283 Project, we're creating an automatic plant monitoring and irrigation system. Utilizing arithmetic, sequential, and combinational circuits, the system intelligently responds to inputs from various sensors like Soil Moisture, Water Level, Temperature, Light Intensity, and Nutrient Levels. It automatically decides when to irrigate, refill water, and supply fertilizers, optimizing plant care. The project, a collaborative effort among our team, incorporates components like logic gates, sensors, and displays, showcasing a blend of technical innovation and sustainable agriculture.
